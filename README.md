# TESS_Cluster_Age_ML
Repo for the working Directory of ML techniques to predict Star cluster ages from integrated light curves


Light Curve summary statistics for data augmented light curves are available in the data folder. Trying to get the actual light curve fits files in the light_curves folder


Jupyter Notebooks are in the home directory. Paths will need to be updated


Files:

Reading_in_LCs_Data_Augmentation_and_Getting_stats_Every_Sector.ipynb
	- was used to generate the summary statistics data tables
Reading_in_LCs_Data_Augmentation_and_Getting_stats_Every_Sector_wPeriodogram.ipynb 
	- Modified version of Tobin's original version
	- was used to generate the summary statistics + period-gram data tables (added by CGW)
GussianNN_CGW
	- Folder where I, CGW, am adding the gaussian NN notebooks I have been working on.
